/**
 * @fileoverview Data Loader for Donation Dashboard
 *
 * This module provides functionality to load and process donation data from a TSV file.
 * It enriches the raw data with cumulative sums, projections, and other derived metrics
 * to support the visualization of donation trends and year-end forecasts.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Parses donation data from a TSV file.
 * - Enriches data with cumulative sums for donations and needs.
 * - Calculates year-end projections based on recent trends.
 * - Supports flexible data structures for use in D3.js visualizations.
 *
 * Exports:
 * - `ProcessedEntry`: Interface defining the structure of enriched donation data.
 * - `loadData`: Function to load and process the donation data.

	pledged: number // Amount pledged but not yet received.

/**
 * Load and process donation data from a TSV file.
 *
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Parses the TSV file into raw data rows.
 * 2. Enriches each row with derived metrics, including:
 *    - Cumulative sums for donations and needs.
 *    - Year-end projections based on recent donation trends.
 * 3. Sorts the data chronologically by column index.
 *
 * @param file Relative path to the `.tsv` file.
 * @returns A promise resolving to an array of processed donation entries.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const data = await loadData('donations.tsv')
 * console.log(data)
 * ```
